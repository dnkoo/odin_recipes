  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>This Lasagna Recipe</strong> is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. <strong>BONUS:</strong> it's make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</p>
  <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
  <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>For the meat sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</em></li>
      <li><em>1 pound ground beef chuck</em></li>
      <li><em>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</em></li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Method</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil:</strong><br>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Brown the ground beef:</strong><br>In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</strong><br>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo, we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</li>
    </ol>
