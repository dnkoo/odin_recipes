    <h1>Porcupine Meatballs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Porcupine meatballs have captured the imaginations of my two preschool-aged daughters. With fluffy grains of rice sticking out all over, they really do resemble little woodland creatures, nestled in their tomato sauce with quills at the ready. They are truly a sight to behold when you lift the lid off of the skillet.</p>
    <p>Despite their spiky appearance, these meatballs are soft and tender. A fun and retro dish, they started to appear in the early 20th century but gained popularity post World War II, when brands like Hunt's printed recipes for porcupine meatballs in ads for their tomato sauce.</p>
 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>For the meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>1 pound ground beef (85% to 90% lean)</em></li>
      <li><em>1/2 cup water</em></li>
      <li><em>1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice</em></li>
      <li><em>1/4 medium yellow onion, finely diced</em></li>
      <li><em>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</em></li>
      <li><em>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the meatball mixture:</strong><br>Add the beef, water, rice, onion, salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl. Stir or use your hands to mix until evenly combined.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Prepare the tomato sauce:</strong><br>Heat the oil and garlic in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to bubble around the edges, add the onions and celery and sauté until the onions are beginning to soften and become translucent, 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and water.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Cook the meatballs in the sauce:</strong><br>When the sauce comes up to a simmer, use a 2 1/2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion out the meatballs, dropping them into the sauce in a single layer. You can also roll the meatballs in your hands—aim for approximately golf ball-sized meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
